                <p>Valorant is a 2020 first-person tactical hero shooter video game developed and published by Riot Games. A free-to-play game, Valorant takes inspiration from the Counter-Strike series, borrowing several mechanics such as the buy menu, spray
                    patterns, and inaccuracy while moving. Development started in 2014 and was teased under the codename Project A in 2019; the game was released on June 2, 2020 for Windows. It was ported to the Xbox Series X/S and PlayStation 5 in June
                    2024, albeit without crossplay between PC and console clients.</p>

                <p>Battlegrounds (previously known as PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds) is a 2017 battle royale video game published by Krafton, and developed by Krafton's PUBG Studios. The game, which was inspired by the Japanese film Battle Royale (2000),
                    is based on previous mods created by Brendan "PlayerUnknown" Greene for other games, and expanded into a standalone game under Greene's creative direction. Played from either a third-person or first-person perspective, up to one hundred
                    players parachute onto an island where they are tasked to scavenge for weapons and equipment to kill other players while avoiding getting killed themselves. The available safe area of the game's map decreases in size over time, directing
                    surviving players into an ever-tightening space to force encounters.</p>
